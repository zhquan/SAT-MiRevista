          <h1>News</h1>
          <h2>January 8, 2007</h2>
          <p>Look what happened!  After nearly a year (and over 12,000 downloads from various sites) since I released <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/2782">Antique Modern</a> to the community, I have finally created one of the most requested changes - BLUE.  Some people didn't like the colors, and I basically told them they could fly a kite!  Well, that was until now.  I had a few changes to the design (see below) and decided to release a separate color scheme along with the enhancements.  I hope people like this one as much as the last!</p>
          <h3>Enhancements from Antique Modern</h3>
          <h4>Menu</h4>
          <p>Previously the menu was aligned right, and the header aligned left.  This became troublesome when they merged.  The menu would fall below.  While I can't make the number of tabs unlimited, you can now have up to 7 without any negative effects.</p>
          <h4>Sidebar</h4>
          <p>In the &quot;Antique Modern&quot; design, the sidebar would usually never be the same length as the content.  This was not a complete problem, but it felt like a design flaw.  Fixed that right up!</p>
          <h4>Images and Dropshadows</h4>
          <p>I am not a graphic designer.  I am a programmer.  So when it came to pass that I started designing webpages, it wasn't perfect.  I had dropshadows with different light sources, and didnt understand how to export them correctly.  That is mostly fixed in this new design with new colors.  It isn't perfect.  I am still not completely inclined to seeing graphics the way many artsy people do.</p>
          <h4>Other Changes</h4>
          <p>Well, nothing really.  Honestly, most of the stuff on this design is exactly as it was before.  Have fun!</p>
